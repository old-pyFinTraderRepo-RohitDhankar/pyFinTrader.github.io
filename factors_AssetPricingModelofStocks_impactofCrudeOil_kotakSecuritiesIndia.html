<p><strong>Current Account Deficit (CAD) and Rupee depreciation:</strong></p>
<p>Every U$10/bbl increase in oil price leads to a 0.55% or 55 bps increase in the current account deficit. Crude oil is one of the most important commodities in recent time. India is one of the largest importers of oil in the world. It imports more than three-fourths of its oil needs. Therefore, a fall in the price of crude oil will have a positive impact on Indiaâ€™s current account deficit situation. Lower CAD will mean reduced stress on foreign currency outflows. This, in turn, may lead to rupee appreciation. If the value of rupee appreciates, the imports become cheaper. This will affect the companies who depend on import crude oil and other raw materials, for their business. The price of stocks of these companies will thus experience a rise.</p>

<p><strong>Inflation:</strong></p>

Inflation is often perceived negatively by an investor. Thus, a comparatively lower inflation level will be beneficial for the stock market.</p>
